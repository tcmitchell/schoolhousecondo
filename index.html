The School-House Condominium building was previously an elementary
school &mdash; "Charles Perkins School, A.D. MDCCCXCI" read the carved
letters above the front door (<a href="#1901view">1901 view</a>).


<p>
In 1980, the architect
<a href="http://www.gundpartnership.com/">Graham Gund</a> converted the schoolhouse building into a 21-unit condominium, known at the School-House Condominium. Gund and his firm are
award winning architects who have worked on many impressive projects; see
www.grahamgund.com.  In 1981, the building reuse project was written about in
<I>Architectural Record</I> ("The Fall and Rise of a 19th Century Schoolhouse,"
Mid-February 1981, Record Interiors 1981 issue &mdash; <a href="#archrecord">see below</a>) and in the <I>The Boston Globe
Magazine</i> (Robert Campbell, "Postmodernism Goes to School," July 12, 1981 &mdash; <a href="#globemag">see below</a>).
Particularly noted in the magazine pieces was the metaphorical scene of nature
of the condominium building's inner lobby, shown below. <BR>

<P>Over the years, the condominium owners (who self manage the
building rather than depending on a hired management company) have
been good stewards of the building and site. Both the exterior of the
building and the inner lobby look more or less as fresh now as they do in the
photos from the 1981 magazine pieces.  (In the late 1990s the condominium association briefly experimented with hiring
a management company.  This experiment lasted two years before the owners decided to return to the self-management model
which worked better for this condominium association.  During that experimental period, a <a href="condo-mag-1991.pdf">brief article about the condominium</a>
was printed in <i>Condo Magazine</i>.

<p>The School-House is within the St. Botolph protected architectural district. The Boston Landmarks Commission <a href="StBotolph_landmarks-study.pdf">report leading to the designation as a protected district</a> is interesting reading.
There is also an interesting <a href="durham-street.pdf">history of the neighborhood</a>, albeit with a focus on Durham St.

<p>We have <a href="redevelopment.html">some photos and other information</a> from the time of the redevelopment of the building by Gund.

<p>There is some confusion in the published literature about which architect designed the school building originally ca. 1891 (<a href="#archwho">discussed below</a>).

<p>We have <a href="1991-party.html">some photos and other artifacts from 1991</a> when the building residents celebrated the centennial of the building's construction.

<p>Jane Brown Gillette wrote an <a href="gund-style.pdf">article entitled "In the Gund Style"</a> which starts by mentioning the Schoolhouse and shows a photo of it a few pages in.  This was published in <i>Historic Preservation</i> (now <i>Preservation</i> magazine), January-February 1994, pp. 46-53.

Harrison Henry Atwood (Boston City Architect, 1889-1891) designed the Charles
C. Perkins school building.  It was mostly constructed and was completed while Edmund M.
Wheelwright was City Architect (1891-1895).  During its design and construction period,
the school was known as the primary school in the Prince school district.  In 1894 it was
named after Charles C. Perkins, a Boston School Committee member from 1871 -1884 and
"art critic, author, organizer of cultural activities, and an influential friend of
design and of music in Boston."

The Bowditch School, also by Atwood, has external similarities to our Schoolhouse
